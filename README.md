# neuroassist

Neuro Assist is a mobile application crafted to support and empower neurodivergent individuals
through an empathetic blend of technology and personalization.

Designed with inclusivity and flexibility at its heart, Neuro Assist uses cutting-edge AI to
personalize support and adapt to users' changing needs, helping them thrive in a world that
often lacks accommodation.

## Getting Started

Neurodivergent individuals face:
• Overwhelm in emotionally intense or overstimulating environments

• Difficulty transitioning between tasks or activities

• Barriers to staying focused or productive

• A lack of accessible, stigma-free tools designed for them, not just adapted to them

Neuro Assist aims to address these issues holistically through tailored interventions and
features that prioritize usability, autonomy, and emotional safety.
